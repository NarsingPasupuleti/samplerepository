This is narsing Rao. I am having 5 years of experience into QA. In which,
3 years is into manual testing and 2 years into automation testing.
Coming to automation I have experience into using cypress with javascript.
I have experience in to DB testing as well.

Coming to my roles and responsibilities 

We are following agile methodology where our sprint size is 2 weeks.
We start pick manual test cases and start automating. 
Per sprint we automate 10 story points. Which covers 5-7 test cases per sprint.

Also we participate in scrum call and retrospective meetings. 

We maintain our test cases in GitHub and we run our test cases in Jenkins.

As a team member, I also review the test cases of other testers.
